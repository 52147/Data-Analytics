# Data

## data
- data is based on collected facts.
- Fairness:
  - Fairness means ensuring that your analysis doesn't create or reinforce bias. 
  -As a data analyst, you want to help create systems that are fair and inclusive to everyone. 
  - Sometimes conclusions based on data can be true and unfair.

- For example:
  - The company with all boys.
  - There isn't much representation of other genders. 
  - This company wants to see which employees are doing well, so they start gathering data on employee performance and their own company culture. 
- Bias conclusion:
  - The data shows that men are the only people succeeding at this company. Their conclusion? That they should hire more men. 
- That's not a fair conclusion for a couple of reasons. 
  - 1. First, it doesn't even consider all of the available data on company culture, so it paints an incomplete picture. 
  - 2. Second, it doesn't think about the other surrounding factors that impact the data, or in other words, the conclusion doesn't consider the difficulties that people of different gender identities have trying to navigate a toxic work environment. 
  
- If the company only looks at this conclusion, they won't acknowledge and address how harmful their culture is and they won't understand why certain people are set up to fail within it.
-  That's why it's important to keep fairness in mind when analyzing data. The conclusion that only men are succeeding at this company is true, but it ignores other systematic factors that are contributing to this problem. 
- Fair conclusion:
  -  An ethical data analyst can look at the data gathered and conclude that the company culture is preventing some employees from succeeding, and the company needs to address those problems to boost performance.
