# Data

## data
- Data based on facts:
  - data is based on collected facts.
- Fairness on conclusion:
  - Fairness means ensuring that your analysis doesn't create or reinforce bias. 
  -As a data analyst, you want to help create systems that are fair and inclusive to everyone. 
  - Sometimes conclusions based on data can be true and unfair.

- For example:
  - The company with all boys.
  - There isn't much representation of other genders. 
  - This company wants to see which employees are doing well, so they start gathering data on employee performance and their own company culture. 
- Bias conclusion:
  - The data shows that men are the only people succeeding at this company. Their conclusion? That they should hire more men. 
- That's not a fair conclusion for a couple of reasons. 
  - 1. First, it doesn't even consider all of the available data on company culture, so it paints an incomplete picture. 
  - 2. Second, it doesn't think about the other surrounding factors that impact the data, or in other words, the conclusion doesn't consider the difficulties that people of different gender identities have trying to navigate a toxic work environment. 
  
- If the company only looks at this conclusion, they won't acknowledge and address how harmful their culture is and they won't understand why certain people are set up to fail within it.
-  That's why it's important to keep fairness in mind when analyzing data. The conclusion that only men are succeeding at this company is true, but it ignores other systematic factors that are contributing to this problem. 
- Fair conclusion:
  -  An ethical data analyst can look at the data gathered and conclude that the company culture is preventing some employees from succeeding, and the company needs to address those problems to boost performance.


collecting data for what purpose:

- 1. make money : 
- Because of the way that organizations have imperatives to make money or to report to somebody or provide some analysis, 
- 2. benefit people :
  - 1. have a responsibility to those people that are represented in those data
    - we also have to keep strongly in mind how this is actually going to benefit people at the end of the day. 
    - Are the people represented in this data going to be benefited by this?  
    - I think aspiring data analysts need to keep in mind that a lot of the data that you're going to encounter is data that comes from people so at the end of the day, data are people. 
  - 2. thinking about how to keep aspects of their data protected and private. 
    - We don't want to go through our practice thinking about data instances as something we can just throw on the web. 
    - No, there needs to be considerations about how to keep that information, and likenesses like their images, or their voices, or their text.

## Interview best practice
1. update your personal project:
- Think about a time where you've used data to solve a problem, whether it's in your professional or personal projects.
2. increase professopnal network
- data analyst that's looking for a new job is to increase your professional network. There are many ways to increase your professional network. 
- One of them is to increase your online footprint, reach out to other analysts on LinkedIn, join local meet-ups with other data scientists. 
- Sometimes when we're looking for a unique skill set, recruiters are going on websites like LinkedIn, and GitHub, and trying to find that talent themselves. 
- **It's really important to have your LinkedIn updated along with websites like GitHub, where you can showcase a lot of the data analysts projects you've done.**
3. in-person interview
- Another tip I would say for an in-person interview is to prepare questions for the interviewer. Make sure they're not broad questions. 
- They should be questions that will help you understand the team and the job better. 
- If you're given a case study in an interview, you should expect to be given a business problem along with the sample data set. 
- Then you'd be asked to take that sample data set, analyze it, and come up with a solution. One of the things you can do to help prepare yourself for this is to ensure you are analyzing the data and coming up with a solution that relates back to that data. 
- **Sometimes there is no right answer, and a lot of times interviewers are looking to see your thought process and the way you get to your solution.**
4. Look for the recruiter
- I highly encourage that if you find a role that you're interested in, not only apply to it, but go the next step. Look for the recruiter. 
- Look for the hiring manager online. See if you can reach out to them and set up a coffee chat or send them your resume directly. 
- Online applications could be a really big black hole where you never hear back from the recruiter or the team. 
- When you reach out directly to a hiring manager or recruiter, it really **shows your eagerness for the role and your interests for the role.** 
- Even if sometimes you don't get a response from reaching out, you never know, you try multiple different times. 
- That one time you get a response back from a recruiter or hiring manager, could be the time you get the job that you really wanted.


## Test-taking strategies

1. Before taking an assessment: 
   - Review your notes, the videos, the readings, and the most recent glossary to refresh yourself on the content. 

   - Find a picture of something or an object that makes you feel happy. For example, you might look at a photograph of a beautiful beach or a peaceful forest when you feel overwhelmed. 

2. During the assessment:
  - Review the test before filling in answers. Remember to check your work before you click submit. 

  - Take your time. You are given a full five minutes per question on all graded assessments.

  - Answer the easy questions first; skip the ones you don’t know the answer to right away.

  - For multiple choice questions, focus on eliminating the wrong answers first. 

  - **Read each question twice. There are often clues that are easy to miss the first time.**

  - **Remember to slow down and trust your knowledge. You probably know more than you give yourself credit for.**

  - **Take a deep breath and give yourself positive feedback.**

  - Take some time during the assessment to rest for a few seconds, stretch, and shake out your hands. This can really help calm your nerves.

3. If you start to feel anxious:
  - **Spell your name backwards or do an easy math problem. This brings you back to the frontal lobe of your brain, which helps you recall information more easily. **

  - Focus on calm, steady breathing. 

  - **Visualize success.**

4.  Before you submit the assessment:
  - Check your work, but be confident. Sometimes people change correct answers because they feel wrong, but they’re actually right. **Your first instinct is usually correct.**
